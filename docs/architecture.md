# RadisProject Architecture Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the RadisProject system architecture, detailing each high-level component and explaining the data flow between modules.

## System Components

RadisProject is designed as a modular system that enables intelligent agent interactions through a flexible framework. The architecture emphasizes:

*   **Modularity**: Components can be developed and enhanced independently
*   **Extensibility**: New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes
*   **Security**: Identity management and security controls are embedded throughout
*   **Context Management**: Advanced memory and context handling for coherent interactions

The RadisProject architecture consists of four primary components:

### Agent Framework

The Agent Framework is the core of RadisProject, orchestrating interactions between users, tools, and LLM backends.

*   **RadisAgent**: The primary agent class that coordinates all interactions, manages context, and executes the reasoning-action loop.
*   **Agent Interface**: Defines the contract that all agent implementations must follow, providing methods for processing requests, managing state, and generating responses.

### Core Components

These components provide essential functionality that supports agent operations.

*   **ContextManager**: Maintains and manages different context objects throughout the system, ensuring appropriate context is available to the agent at the right time.
*   **SessionContext**: Represents the current state of a user session, including history, preferences, and active tools.
*   **RollingWindowMemory**: Implements a thread-safe, size-limited memory system that maintains a sliding window of recent interactions.

### Identity & Security Framework

The Identity & Security framework ensures appropriate boundaries, consistent identity, and secure operation.

*   **Identity Context**: Manages the agent's identity, personality, and behavioral constraints.
*   **Response Processor**: Filters and processes LLM outputs to ensure compliance with identity rules and security policies.

### Tool Registry

The Tool Registry enables extensible functionality through a plugin architecture.

*   **ToolRegistry**: Central registry that maintains available tools, their metadata, and access control.
*   **BaseTool**: Abstract base class that defines the interface for all tools in the system.
*   **Tool Metrics**: Monitors and records tool usage, performance, and errors.

## Data Flow

The system operates through several key data flows that span multiple components:

### Context Flow

```
User Input -> RadisAgent -> ContextManager -> SessionContext -> LLM Prompt
```

The context flow ensures that conversational history, system state, and user-specific information are properly maintained and available.

### Tool Execution Cycle

```
Agent -> ToolRegistry -> Tool Instance -> Execution -> Metrics Collection -> Results -> Agent
```

The tool execution cycle enables the agent to perform actions in the environment by locating, invoking, and processing results from appropriate tools.

### LLM Interaction

```
Enriched Prompt -> LLM Backend -> Raw Response -> Response Processor -> Filtered Response -> Agent -> User
```

The LLM interaction flow manages the communication with language model backends, ensuring appropriate context is provided and responses are properly processed before being delivered to users.

### Memory Management

```
Interactions -> RollingWindowMemory -> Context Selection -> Prompt Construction
```

The memory management flow governs how information is retained, prioritized, and incorporated into future interactions.

## Concurrency and Thread Safety

RadisProject implements several strategies to ensure thread-safe operation:

*   **Locks**: Carefully placed locks ensure that critical sections are accessed by only one thread at a time.
*   **Thread-Safe Collections**: Components like RollingWindowMemory use thread-safe collections (deques) to prevent concurrency issues.
*   **Immutable Patterns**: Where possible, immutable data structures are used to prevent unintended modifications.
