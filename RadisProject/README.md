**RadisProject is a cutting-edge AI agent framework designed to facilitate the development and deployment of intelligent, autonomous agents in complex computing environments.**

## Executive Summary

RadisProject provides a robust and extensible platform for building AI agents that can seamlessly interact with their environment, leverage a diverse set of tools, and maintain consistent identity and security. Our framework is engineered for high performance, scalability, and ease of integration, enabling organizations to rapidly develop and deploy AI-powered solutions.

## Key Features

*   **Advanced Tool Registry:** A centralized system for managing and accessing a wide range of tools, enabling agents to perform complex tasks.
*   **Identity & Security Framework:** Ensures consistent agent identity, enforces security policies, and prevents unauthorized access.
*   **Optimized Concurrency:** Designed for multi-GPU environments, maximizing resource utilization and performance.
*   **Comprehensive Context Management:** Advanced memory and context handling for coherent and context-aware interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11+
*   Conda (recommended)

### Installation

1.  **Create a Conda Environment:**

    ```bash
    conda create -n radis python=3.11
    conda activate radis
    ```
2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://example.com/RadisProject.git
    cd RadisProject
    ```
3.  **Install RadisProject:**

    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[gpu]"  # For GPU support
    # Or, for specific GPU support:
    pip install -e ".[rocm]" # For AMD GPUs (ROCm)
    pip install -e ".[cuda]" # For NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA)
    ```

### Basic Usage

```python
from app.agent import RadisAgent
from app.core import ContextManager
from app.tool import ToolRegistry

# Initialize the agent with session context
context_manager = ContextManager()
session_context = context_manager.get_context("user_session_123")
agent = RadisAgent(session_context=session_context)

# Access the tool registry
tool_registry = ToolRegistry.get_instance()

# Run the agent with a task
result = agent.run("Summarize the key findings in the research paper.")

print(result)
```

## Architecture Overview

RadisProject's architecture is built upon four core components:

*   **Agent Framework:** Orchestrates interactions, manages context, and executes the reasoning-action loop.
*   **Core Components:** Provides essential functionality for context management, session state, and memory.
*   **Identity & Security Framework:** Enforces security boundaries, maintains consistent identity, and sanitizes responses.
*   **Tool Registry:** Enables extensible functionality through a plugin architecture.

For a detailed architectural overview, please refer to the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).
