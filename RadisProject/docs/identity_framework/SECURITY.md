# Security Boundaries

The Identity Framework implements robust security boundaries to ensure safe operation of the AI agent within well-defined limits.

## Overview

Security boundaries in the Identity Framework provide:
- Workspace containment
- Path traversal prevention
- Identity disclosure prevention
- Command execution safeguards
- Data access controls

## Core Security Concepts

### Workspace Boundary

The workspace boundary restricts file operations to a specific directory tree:

```python
from app.agent.identity_context import RadisIdentityContext
from app.errors import SecurityBoundaryError

# Create identity context with workspace boundary
identity_context = RadisIdentityContext(
    workspace_root="/path/to/project",
    enforce_boundaries=True  # Default is True
)

# This would pass validation
valid_path = identity_context.validate_path("/path/to/project/data.txt")

# This would raise SecurityBoundaryError
try:
    invalid_path = identity_context.validate_path("/etc/passwd")
except SecurityBoundaryError as e:
    print(f"Security violation: {e}")
```

### Path Traversal Prevention

The framework prevents path traversal attacks:

```python
# These would all raise SecurityBoundaryError if they
# resolve to paths outside the workspace
problematic_paths = [
    "/path/to/project/../../../etc/passwd",
    "~/secret_file.txt",
    "/path/to/project/subdir/../../../outside.txt"
]

for path in problematic_paths:
    try:
        identity_context.validate_path(path)
    except SecurityBoundaryError:
        print(f"Blocked path traversal attempt: {path}")
```

### Identity Protection

The security boundaries include protection against identity disclosure:

```python
from app.agent.response_processor import ResponseProcessor

processor = ResponseProcessor()

# This would be sanitized to replace model references
response = "I am an AI assistant based on GPT-4."
sanitized = processor.process_response(response, identity_context)
# Result: "I am an AI assistant based on Radis."
```

### Command Execution Safeguards

Commands executed through the framework are validated:

```python
# Safe command execution
result = identity_context.execute_command(
    "ls -la",
    validate=True  # Default is True
)

# This would raise SecurityCommandError
try:
    identity_context.execute_command("rm -rf /")
except SecurityCommandError:
    print("Blocked dangerous command")
```

## Security Features

### Project Boundary Enforcement

All file operations are restricted to the defined project workspace:

```python
# Define canonical project root
project_root = os.path.realpath("/path/to/project")

# All operations will be validated against this root
identity_context = RadisIdentityContext(workspace_root=project_root)
```

### Path Sanitization

Paths are normalized and validated:

```python
# Normalizes paths and checks boundaries
safe_path = identity_context.sanitize_path("./subdir/../file.txt")

# Converts relative paths to absolute within boundary
abs_path = identity_context.get_absolute_path("data/config.json")
```

### Command History Monitoring

All commands are tracked for security auditing:

```python
# Record command with security metadata
identity_context.record_command(
    command="git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git",
    working_dir="/path/to/project",
    success=True,
    metadata={"security_level": "standard"}
)

# Retrieve command history for audit
high_risk_commands = identity_context.get_commands_by_metadata(
    "security_level", "high"
)
```

### Security Errors

Specialized security error classes:

```python
from

# Security Boundaries

## Overview

Security boundaries protect system integrity through working directory restrictions, file access controls, and tool execution boundaries.

## Components

### Working Directory Management
- Restricts operations to project scope
- Tracks directory changes
- Prevents unauthorized traversal
- Maintains execution context

### File Access Control
- Validates file operations
- Enforces permissions
- Prevents path manipulation
- Logs access attempts

### Tool Execution Boundaries
- Validates tool commands
- Restricts resource access
- Manages cleanup operations
- Tracks execution context

## Implementation

### Directory Validation
```python
class SecurityBoundary:
    def validate_working_dir(self, path: str) -> bool
    def check_file_access(self, path: str) -> bool
    def validate_tool_execution(self, command: str) -> bool
    def cleanup_resources(self) -> None
```

### Access Control
```python
def enforce_boundaries(self):
    - Check current directory
    - Validate file operations
    - Monitor tool execution
    - Track resource usage
```

## Security Rules

1. **File Access**
   - Only access project files
   - Respect file permissions
   - No symbolic link traversal
   - Log all operations

2. **Directory Control**
   - Stay within project root
   - Track directory changes
   - Prevent upward traversal
   - Monitor current path

3. **Tool Execution**
   - Validate commands
   - Check resource limits
   - Monitor output
   - Clean up resources

## Best Practices

1. Always validate paths
2. Track directory changes
3. Monitor file access
4. Log security events
5. Clean up resources
