# Identity Management

## Overview

The identity management system ensures consistent agent identity and behavior through command tracking, project boundary enforcement, and identity rule validation.

## Key Features

### Command History
- Tracks executed commands with metadata:
  - Command string
  - Timestamp
  - Working directory
  - Success/failure status
- Maintains historical context for decision making
- Provides audit trail for debugging

### Project Boundaries
- Enforces working directory restrictions
- Validates file access within project scope
- Prevents unauthorized directory traversal
- Manages resource access permissions

### Identity Rules
- Prevents self-reference as AI model
- Enforces consistent "Radis" identity
- Validates response content
- Maintains personality consistency

### Identity Context
```python
class RadisIdentityContext:
    def validate_command(self, command: str) -> bool
    def track_command(self, command: str, success: bool) -> None
    def check_boundaries(self, path: str) -> bool
    def validate_identity(self, content: str) -> bool
```

## Usage

### Initializing Identity Context
```python
context = RadisIdentityContext(project_root="/path/to/project")
```

### Validating Commands
```python
if context.validate_command(command):
    # Execute command
    success = execute_command(command)
    context.track_command(command, success)
```

### Checking Boundaries
```python
if context.check_boundaries(file_path):
    # Access file
    process_file(file_path)
```

## Best Practices

1. Always initialize with correct project root
2. Track all command executions
3. Validate paths before access
4. Check identity rules for responses
5. Maintain command history for debugging
