# RadisProject Changelog

## LM Studio Integration Update - March 30, 2025

### Enhanced Tokenization for Model Support

- Added a dedicated `ModelTokenizer` class that dynamically selects the appropriate tokenizer based on the model type
- Fixed "Model not supported by tiktoken" warnings by implementing proper tokenization for:
  - Gemma models (using cl100k_base encoding)
  - Qwen models (using cl100k_base encoding)
  - LLaMA family models
  - Mistral family models
- Added fallback tokenization for models without direct tiktoken support
- Implemented token counting for both prompt and completion to provide accurate metrics

### Response Processing and Sanitization

- Added a `ResponseSanitizer` class to clean and improve model outputs
- Implemented intelligent extraction of initial responses (removing hallucinated continuations)
- Added sanitization to remove redundant newlines, unsafe content, and fix formatting
- Added proper source identification with RadisProject attribution in responses
- Added detailed logging of token usage and response processing

### Improved Model Detection

- Added automatic model detection to dynamically configure the tokenizer
- Implemented multiple fallback strategies for model detection
- Added configuration options to override automatic detection

### Technical Implementation

- Modularized code for better maintainability and reuse
- Implemented more robust error handling
- Added detailed logging throughout the process
- Improved type hints for better code quality

### Command-line Interface Improvements

- Added options to control tokenization and sanitization behavior
- Added support for explicitly specifying the model or using auto-detection
- Improved help messages and documentation

### Attribution Correction

- Changed final response attribution from "Response from LM Studio" to "AgentRadis Response"
- Ensured RadisProject is properly identified as the provider of the analysis, not just a pass-through
- Added token processing statistics to help users understand resource usage

This update ensures that RadisProject properly handles different model types, 
provides accurate token counting, and delivers clean, properly attributed responses
to users as the final step in the analysis pipeline.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the runner script was calling a non-existent method `process_llm_response` on the RadisAgent
- Moved response processing directly into the runner script
- Ensured proper attribution is added to all responses
