##### 2. Affected Methods
  - Fixed _create_chat_completion_sdk method's remote_call usage
  - Fixed create_embeddings method's remote_call usage
  - Ensured proper parameter passing format across all LM Studio API calls

#### Testing and Verification
- Verified the fix addresses the error "SyncSession.remote_call() got an unexpected keyword argument 'method'"
- Confirmed WebSocket API calls now work correctly with the LM Studio client
- Tested both completion and embedding functionality through the remote_call API

#### Changed Code
```python
# Before (problematic):
response = self._lmstudio_client.llm.remote_call(
    method="_complete",
    kwargs={
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": kwargs.get("max_tokens", 1024),
        "temperature": kwargs.get("temperature", 0.7),
        "stop": kwargs.get("stop", None)
    })

# After (fixed):
response = self._lmstudio_client.llm.remote_call(
    "_complete",
    {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": kwargs.get("max_tokens", 1024),
        "temperature": kwargs.get("temperature", 0.7),
        "stop": kwargs.get("stop", None)
    })
```

### LM Studio WebSocket URL Fix

#### Overview
Fixed an issue in the LMStudioClient class where WebSocket URLs were incorrectly formed with double protocols (e.g., `ws://http://127.0.0.1:1234/llm` instead of `ws://127.0.0.1:1234/llm`), preventing successful WebSocket connections.

#### Detailed Changes

##### 1. Fixed Host:Port Extraction in _initialize_clients
  - Fixed indentation issues in the _initialize_clients method
  - Enhanced the host:port extraction logic from API base URLs
  - Added more robust handling for URLs with or without protocol prefixes
  - Ensured the lmstudio.Client is only created with the host:port portion
  - Added clear logging to indicate which host:port is being used

#### 3. Code Structure Improvements
  - Fixed indentation inconsistencies in the _initialize_clients method
  - Correctly nested all initialization logic within proper code blocks
  - Maintained existing model loading logic with llm.connect()
  - Improved error handling for client initialization

### Testing and Verification
- Created test script to verify proper WebSocket URL formation
- Confirmed WebSocket connections are successfully established
- Tested with both protocol-prefixed and non-prefixed API base URLs
- Verified that all LM Studio client functionality works with the fix

### Changed Code
```python
# Before (problematic):
# host_port = self.api_base.rstrip('/')
# self._lmstudio_client = lmstudio.Client(api_host=host_port)

# After (fixed):
host_port_pattern = re.compile(r'(?:https?://)?([^/]+)')
match = host_port_pattern.search(self.api_base)
if match:
    host_port = match.group(1)
else:
    # Fallback with explicit protocol stripping
    host_port = self.api_base.replace('http://', '').replace('https://', '').rstrip('/')

self._lmstudio_client = lmstudio.Client(api_host=host_port)
```
